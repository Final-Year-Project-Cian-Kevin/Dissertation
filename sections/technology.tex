% ========================== Frame Work  ========================== 

\section{MEAN STACK/Framework}
brief into on mean stack and why we chose. Maybe split to front end and backend?
api?
typescript?

The mean stack is intended to provide a simple and fun starting point for cloud native fullstack javascript applications.
MEAN is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications; starting from the top (code running in the browser) to the bottom (database). The stack is made up of:
\begin{itemize}
\item MongoDB
\item Express
\item Angular
\item Node.js

\end{itemize}

\subsection{MongoDB}
Document database – used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents

\subsection{Express}
sometimes referred to as Express.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js

\subsection{Angular}
(formerly Angular.js): Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user’s browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic

\subsection{Node.js}
JavaScript runtime environment – lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScrip
