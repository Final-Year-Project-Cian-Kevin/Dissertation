% MEAN Stack
@article{12931134620180301,
    Abstract = {Most of today's world web applications are designed using a 'stack' of various technologies. MEAN stack and MERN stack are two of the most popular and extremely powerful stacks that are used for the development of modern web applications. MERN stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS and MEAN being for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS. The key factor is that both the stacks ushers under a single umbrella named JavaScript. This ensures faster development and helps developers quickly get products to market as the need of understanding different languages to contribute to both the front-end and back-end gets eliminated, and eventually leads to a huge cut in development costs and improves efficiency. This paper revolves around analyzing features, advantages and disadvantages of the two stacks and also throws light upon the key factors that play a major role during the selection of one out of the former two.

% Cloud Service
@article{S037872061730314220180901,
    Abstract = {Customers of cloud service providers (CSPs) use different criteria to judge the quality of cloud services. Based on managerial and technical Quality-of-Service (QoS) attributes, these criteria provide information on service quality and the CSP itself. Thus, it is important to identify relevant QoS to assure success of customers. Using a Delphi study, 16 professionals characterized by different cloud service models, company sizes, and industries identified and ranked QoS according to their relative importance. Our results show consensus on QoS. We identify functionality, legal compliance, contract, geolocation of servers, and flexibility as top QoS and observe increasing importance of managerial QoS.},
